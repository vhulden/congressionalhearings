# Testimony and Witnesses at U.S. Congressional Hearings


This repository is a holder for code and materials on a project analyzing testimony and witnesses at hearings held by the U.S. Congress. While the data cannot be published here as ProQuest has claims on it, scripts and sample bits of data will be published here.

This is work in progress and all scripts and data are messy. 

Portions of this work have been presented at the Current Research in Digital History conference, the North American Labor History Conference, and at DH2019.
